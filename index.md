### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 1 was a very memorable project as it introduced the concept of arguments. In this project we were assigned to basically ask the user an argument of sandwich contents. We then determined if the input the user gave had the right number of arguments. If so, we were able to assign each argument to a string and output a sentence of their "sandwich order." Being able to determine how many arguments there are and assign a certain argument to a variable was a crucial skill that was used in later projects. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 2 was the project that I had the most fun on because we were able to utilize loops to create a guessing game where the user had to guess a secret number that was intially assigned. The reason why I loved making this game was because we were able to create a variable called last guess which helped us determine whether the user's guess was either hotter or colder to the secret number. The loops made it possible for the code to keep running until the user was able to guess the number or manually stopped the code. This gave a sense of automation which made this project very fun to work on. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of my favorite projects because it was one of the first projects that introduced the concept of making a game, which in this case was Blackjack. We were able to assign the cards their values including the face cards and the ace card. On top of that, being able to add the values together to determine if the players hand was a bust or not. This project used a lot of skills together such as loops, bool, if statements, arguments, and much more. With this project I felt more refined in my knowledge about these skills and thus I would consider this my favorite project.
